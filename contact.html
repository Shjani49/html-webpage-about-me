        The "action" attribute determines which page the data will be sent to.
        The "method" attribute determines whether the data will be stored in the URL or sent securely.
        The "GET" method will store the data in the Url, meaning if the url is sent to sombody, they will have the same exact page,as their url will sent the same data to the server as the original request.
        The "POST" method will submit the data behind the scenes, so if the URL is copied, none of the data
        will be included.-->

            -Radio buttons ("radio")
            -Submit button ("submit")
             The type of element rendered is determined by the "type" attribute.
            The "id" attribute is used to globally identify an element on a page (for CSS / JS) as well as tie it to a label.
            The "name" attribute is used to determine what the field's data will be referred to when it is submitted to the server.
